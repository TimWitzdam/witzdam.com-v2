import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::note
It's recommended to first complete the setup, then disable authentication. Otherwise it will make it impossible to return to GitSave's built in authentication.

<Steps>
1. Setup your own authentication before disabling the existing one
2. Set the environment variable: `DISABLE_AUTH=true`
3. Restart the container
</Steps>
