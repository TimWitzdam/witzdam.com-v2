<Steps>
1. Go into the backup directory (by default `./backups`) and find the repository you want to restore.
2. In it's directory you'll find other directories named after the timestamp of the backups.
3. Now you can use `git clone <timestamp> restored_backup` to restore the backup. It will be saved in a new directory called `restored_backup`.
</Steps>
