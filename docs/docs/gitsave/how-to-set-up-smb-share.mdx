## How to set up SMB share
<Steps>
1. Navigate to Settings > Storage
2. Change the "Default location" to "SMB share"
3. Enter the required details
</Steps>

## If you're getting a connection error:

### Make sure the address is correct
It must not start with / or \
It must end with the name of the share. E.g. `192.168.1.1/backups`

### Check your credentials again
Check the credentials. Maybe you've made a mistake there.

### Check the server connection
Try to ping your SMB server from inside the docker container like this:

:::caution
Check if the container name (GitSave) is correct in your case. Also change the IP of the SMB server.
:::
<div class="not-content">
```bash mark="GitSave"
docker exec GitSave ping 192.168.1.1
```
</div>

### If you're still getting the error
