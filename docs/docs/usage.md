title: Usage limits
description: Explanation of the usage limits of Tim's API collections
---

None of the APIs currently has a pricing model or anything similar. They're all completely free to use.

## Request limits

Every endpoint is limited differently, due to the individual computational work that's done by the backend. The limit corresponding to the endpoint will be visible on its documentation page.

## Attribution

Attribution in general is not required, but it would be a really handsome move by anyone using my APIs.

A simple link to [https://witzdam.com](https://witzdam.com) somewhere at the bottom of the would totally be enough.
