import { Code } from "astro:components";

## Information

The Website Word Counter API allows you to count the words on a website. This tool also works with websites, that rely on Javascript to load their content.

## Endpoint

<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
  <div class="bg-red-500 py-2 px-4 text-sm rounded-lg w-fit text-white font-bold">
    POST
  </div>
  <span>https://api.witzdam.com/tools/website-word-counter</span>
</div>

## Request body

Note: The request can take quite some time, depending on how fast the website you enter loads.

To use the API you must provide the following data as JSON inside the body:

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    url: "https://witzdam.com"
}`}
/>

## Responses

Here's a list of all the responses you can get and an explanation for each of them.

### Success

You can expect this response, when a valid URL is entered.

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    status: "ok",
    data: {
        "visible_words": 120,
        "total_words": 122,
        "top_words": [{
                "word": "Tim",
                "count": 4
            },
            {
                "word": "for",
                "count": 3
            }
        ]
    }
}`}
/>

### Error

When a request fails for different reasons, you'll generally receive a `status: "error"` with a message attatched.

Possible errors are:

#### Some unexpected error

This means, that something internally went wrong. This probably isn't your fault. Please contact me when this happens (contact@witzdam.com).

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    status: "error",
    message: "Something went wrong"
}`}
/>

#### Invalid data provided

This happens, when you send invalid data inside the body. You can get one of these 3 responses:

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    status: "error",
    message: "Invalid URL provided" // Syntax check failed
}`}
/>

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    status: "error",
    message: "No URL provided in request" // URL missing inside request body
}`}
/>

<Code
  lang="json"
  code={`{
    status: "error",
    message: "No data provided in request" // Request body is empty
}`}
/>

## Request limit

This endpoint is limited to `100 requests per hour`.
